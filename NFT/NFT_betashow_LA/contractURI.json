    "description": "We are in an era of change, the way we see ourselves and the world around us is changing faster than ever before. Amidst this change, art serves as the great equalizer, bringing people closer together at a time where connection is our limitless currency. This show is about sharing the perspectives artists see for the past, present, and future in order to foster a dialogue which broadens our collective perspective. Because of art, we find connection, community, solace, and hope, and because of artists, we write humanityâ€™s story together. AS FAR AS WE CAN SEE will serve as a kind reminder of this perspective, showcasing limited edition work from 30 international artists as NFTs and physical pieces.",
